I am a prospective M.Sc. Economics student at [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) starting in 2024. Previously, I earned a B.Sc. in Economics from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en).<br><br>
My research interests include computational economics, financial economics, and economic appraisal. I also enjoy exploring topics in applied microeconomics.
