I am a prospective M.Sc. Economics student at [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) starting in 2024. Formerly, I obtained a B.Sc. in Economics from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). <br><br>
My research interests span over computational economics, financial economics and, economic appraisal. I also enjoy working on topics related to applied microeconomics.
